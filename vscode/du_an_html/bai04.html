            Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
            efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
            approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and
            dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
            ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in
            many areas on most platforms.
